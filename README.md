##  Instructions:
First, to navigate to the working directory of the project, please go to working_dir in the repo. Most of our files are located in the src/ folder.<br/>

To run the code, use command "npm install" followed by "npm start". There may be some dependencies that need to be installed manually. We apologize for the inconvenience. We are using a library call "ant design", and somehow "npm install" does not catch all the dependenicies.
