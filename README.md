Welcome to our project!

##  Instructions:
First, to navigate to the working directory of the project, please go to working_dir in the repo. Most of our files are located in the src/ folder.

To run the code, use command "npm install" followed by "npm start". There may be some dependencies that need to be installed manually. We apologize for the inconvenience. We are using a library call "ant design", and somehow "npm install" does not catch all the dependenicies.

### Loggin In:
To log in, use default username "user" and password "user" to gain access to a user profile page where you can view and edit your information.
To log in to an admin page, use username "admin" and password "admin". In this page you can view all of the projects posted and edit them.

### Functionalities:
All users, regardless of logged in or not, will have access to viewing all postings of projects, which are displayed on the default landing page when you open our web application. Users can view the projects, and click on "view" button to see more information about the project posted.
Logged in users can have access to their own profile page, where personal information will be shown.
Logged in users can also post a new project. Your newly added project will show up on the bottom of home/landing page.
